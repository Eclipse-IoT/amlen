# IRQ_AFFINITY_MASK
#    64 bit bitmask which allows you to indicate which cpu's should
#    be skipped when re-balancing irqs.  Cpu numbers which have their 
#    corresponding bits set to zero in this mask will not have any
#    irq's assigned to them on re-balance
#
# M4 servers stay off CPU 6 and 7 when IOP Threads are on Socket 0
IRQ_AFFINITY_MASK=FF3F
# M4 servers stay off CPU 14 and 15 when IOP Threads are on Socket 1
#IRQ_AFFINITY_MASK=3FFF
