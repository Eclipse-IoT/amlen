# Setup MQConnectivity for Automotive User Scale test w/ mar400
# The MQConnectivity has a defect where it doesn't start on KVM,
#
# I had to split out the mqconnectivity_stop and mqconnectivity_start
# from the other mqconnectivity_automotive_user_scale parts due to observation below.
#
# Observation 10.15.12: stop MQConnectivity does not complete with run-cli.sh:
# There is also an issue that mqconnectivity_stop does not complete
# from run-cli.sh perspective even though it actually does complete
# Discussed with James and he said he would be handling it, but that
# it may also be an ismserver defect that they did not support a status for
# MQConnectivity.
#------------------------------------------------------

mqconnectivity_stop 0 stop mqconnectivity 
mqconnectivity_start 0 start mqconnectivity

#------------------------------------------------------
# Commands below wont start working for some time after starting MQConnectivity... (~15 seconds)
# That is why the mqconnectivity_init commands are separate. It is expected that a sleep
# for at least 15 seconds will be executed after mqconnectivity_init is executed before running
# any the mqconnectivity_automotive_user_scale commands.
#
# Note: I had to escape the parenthesis in the QueueManagerConnection command to prevent an 
# error from run-cli.sh
