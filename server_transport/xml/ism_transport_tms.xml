</MsgText>
<Explanation>
<p>The ${IMA_SVR_COMPONENT_NAME} is closing a TCP connection during the handshake with the client.
This indicates that a TCP connection was started but did not complete all start of connection processing.
When a connection is started we need to complete the TCP, SSL/TLS, and protocol handshakes before the
connection can process messages.
There are several problems which can cause this and the reason string can help tell which is the problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>The client does not send any data or disconnects before completing the protocol handshake.</li>
<li>There is a network failure or the network is not configured correctly.</li>
<li>The transport security (SSL/TLS) is not configured correctly or a secure connection could not be established.</li>
</ul>
</Explanation>
<OperatorResponse>
<p>Examine the reason code to determine the reason for the disconnect.
Ensure that the client and server are correctly configured.
Ensure that the client and server SSL/TLS configuration matches.</p>
