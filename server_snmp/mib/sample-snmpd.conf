#
# Typical SNMP Daemon configuration (/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf) 
# for Amlen Server Monitoring
# 
# For SNMP support, Amlen server SNMP sub agent is configured as AgentX.
#
# For details on support OID in Amlen Server, refer to Server MIB file:
#       http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21993987

# Examples of snmpwalk and snmptrap for IBM IoT MessageSight Server OIDs:
#
# snmpwalk examples:
# -----------------
# Invoked from localhost using udp (default protocol) and default port (161):
# snmpwalk -c MessageSight -v 2c -t 60 -r 2 127.0.0.1 .1.3.6.1.4.1.2.6.253
#
# Invoked from a remote IP 32.97.110.51 (authorized by rocommunity configuration item in 
# snmpd.conf file) to snmpd and MessgeSight server running on system whose IP address is
# 184.172.218.133, using tcp protocol and port 161:
# snmpwalk -c MessageSight -v 2c -t 60 -r 2 tcp:184.172.218.133:161 .1.3.6.1.4.1.2.6.253
#
#
# snmptrap example:
# ----------------
# To Test SNMP Trap event functionality in Amlen server:
#
# - You need to have a SNMP receiver in the system where Amlen SNMP AgentX is sending trap events. 
#   Refer to trap2sink configuration item below.
#
# - Execute any memory load test program on the system where imaserver process is running, to make
#   imaserver process to run out of memory and send an SNMP trap for memory usage event. 
#   For example you can run the following script as memory load test program: 
#
#   #!/bin/bash
#   cat <(yes | tr \\n x | head -c 2024000000) <(sleep 45) | grep n
#
# - Wait for memory load test program to finish, then check snmp trap output. You should see tries like:
#   
#   2018-08-21 12:59:32 imaserver.ms-snmp-net [UDP: [172.32.0.2]:46182->[172.32.0.1]:162]:

# Extend Master agent communication with AgentX
#
master          agentx

#
# agentaddress
# Specifies Master agent configuration: protocol, IP address and port
#
# Syntax: [PROTOCOL]:[ADDRESS]:[PORT]
#         PROTOCOL: tcp, upd, tcp6, or udp6 - Default is UDP
#         ADDRESS: ipv4 or ipv6 address - for IpV6 address use [::] - Default is all ipv4 interfaces
#         PORT: Port - Default is 161
#
# Following configuration is for:
# Port: 161
# Interface: Not defined i.e. all interfaces
# Protocol: tcp (ipv4), udp (ipvp4), tcp6 (ipv6), udp6 (ipv6)
#
agentaddress    tcp:161,udp:161,tcp6:161,udp6:161

#
# agentXSocket
# Specifies Sub Agent configuration: protocol, IP address and port.
#
# Syntax: [PROTOCOL]:[ADDRESS]:[PORT]
#         PROTOCOL: tcp, upd, tcp6, or udp6 - Default is UDP
#         ADDRESS: ipv4 or ipv6 address - for IpV6 address use [::] - Default is all ipv4 interfaces
#         PORT: Port - Default is 705
#
# NOTE: Sub agents communicates with master agent (i.e. snmp daemon), typically running on the same host.
#       Use only localhost for sub agent configuration for security reasons. You can also
#       limit protocols used, if needed. 
#
# The following example is for all protocols, localhost (ipv4 and ipv6) and port 705
#
agentXSocket    tcp:localhost:705,tcp6:[::1]:705,udp:localhost:705,udp6:[::1]:705

#
# Set Authority
# 
# rocommunity: Read only community is needed for MessageSight
# Syntax: roommunity CommunityName AllowedIP
#
# Following example authorizes to connections from 127.0.0.1 and 32.97.110.51 (for ipv4)
# and ipv6 localhost
#
rocommunity     MessageSight    127.0.0.1
rocommunity     MessageSight    32.97.110.51
rocommunity6    MessageSight    ::1

#
# trap2sink:
# Specifies the host where SNMP will send trap notification
# Syntax:  trap2sink host [comminity [port]]
#          Default comminuty is public
#          Default port is 162
#
# NOTE: MessageSight has following Notification groups:
#       CommonGroup - For MessageSight server version and Node name
#       MemoryGroup - For Memory usage states
#       MemoryCtrlGroup - For Critical Memory states (alerts and warnings)
#       StoreGroup - For MessageSight store (disk) usage
#       For details refer to IBM IoT MessageSight Server MIB file:
#       http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21993987
#       
# Following example is for sending traps to 32.97.110.51, using community as MessageSight
