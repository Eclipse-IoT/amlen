After an incident where one of our non-transient WAS servers was hacked to be used as a bitcoin miner.

In response, I hardened the machine.  Part of that was to enable iptables.  These intructions are for RHEL6/Centos6 since that was what the machines were running at the time.

1.  Copy the RHEL6_iptables_rules file to the target machine you wish to harden as /etc/sysconfig/iptables

2.  Enable iptables if it isn't already enabled: chkconfig iptables on

3.  Start iptables: service iptables start 

Verify the output to make sure there are no errors.

The rules included in this file close most ports on the external interface (this always seems to be eth1) and opens all the required ports on the internal interface (which seems to always be eth0).
