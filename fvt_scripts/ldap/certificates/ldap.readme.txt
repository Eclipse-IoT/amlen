## README for LDAP test certificates
## Note: Update this readme file if any of the filename is changed

mar080_server.pem is the valid certificate for the LDAP server (ITDS) running on mar080.test.example.com.
    Notes:
	  * Use port 5636 secure connection to LDAP server (ITDS) running on mar080.test.example.com.
	  * Use port 5389 for non-secure connection to LDAP server (ITDS) running on mar080.test.example.com.

mar080_server_bad.pem and mar080_server_bad2.pem are bad certificates which can be used for error testing.

myCert.pem is a valid certificate, but it does not match the keystore on mar080.test.example.com.  Therefore, use this myCert.pem file for error testing.
