The certificates and keystore in this directory are used for negative testing in SSL tests for certificate and security profles.
For valid certs/keystore use the ones in testTools_scripts/common_src

ibm.jks is the same as testTools_scripts/common_src/ibm.jks except that it does not contain a client cert/key pair.
