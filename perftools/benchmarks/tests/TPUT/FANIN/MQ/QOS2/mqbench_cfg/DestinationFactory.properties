DestinationFactory.desc=\
This handles destinations for publish-subscribe and point-to-point domains.\n\
These options only control the *names* given to destinations.  Specifying\n\
"-d TOPIC" does not enable publish-subscribe ("-tc jms.r11.Publisher -d TOPIC" does that)\n\
Examples:\n\
-d QUEUE\n\
	All threads operate on destination named QUEUE\n\
-d MYTOPIC -dn 3\n\
	destinations are distributed round-robin in the order MYTOPIC1..MYTOPIC3\n\
-d MYTOPIC -db 6 -dn 3\n\
	destinations are distributed round-robin in the order MYTOPIC6..MYTOPIC8\n\
-d MYTOPIC -dx 6 -dn 3\n\
	destinations are distributed round-robin in the order MYTOPIC4..MYTOPIC6\n\
-d MYTOPIC -db 4 -dx 6 -dn 5\n\
	destinations are distributed round-robin in the order MYTOPIC4..MYTOPIC6 starting with MYTOPIC5
