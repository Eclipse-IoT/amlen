Publisher.desc = Send messages to a Topic

#
# Following all come from WebSphereMQ.properties
#
jh.dflt = localhost
jh.desc = DNS/IP of provider host machine.
jh.type = java.lang.String

jp.dflt = 1414
jp.desc = Port of provider host machine.
jp.type = java.lang.Integer

jc.dflt = SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN
jc.desc = WMQ Channel to connect to.
jc.type = java.lang.String


jb.dflt = QM
jb.desc = WMQ queue manager to connect to.
jb.type = java.lang.String

jt.dflt = mqc
jt.desc = WMQ transport (mqb, mqc).
jt.type = java.lang.String
jt.xtra = "mqb" is local-bindings connections, "mqc" is TCP/IP connections.

jf.dflt = false
jf.desc = Use the fastpath option on the MQCONNX call
jf.type = java.lang.Boolean
jf.xtra = Using this option means the application and the local-queue-manager agent are part of the same unit\n\
of execution. Using this option should give much higher throughput when using high message rates as it avoids\n\
a lot of thread switching. For this reason it is also easier to compare raw publish and susbscribe performance

jq.dflt = SYSTEM.BROKER.DEFAULT.STREAM
jq.desc = Publish queue.
jq.type = java.lang.String
jq.xtra = This defines the stream for a WMQ broker, and can therefore be set on both publishers\n\
and subscribers.  Note that publications cannot cross streams.  Never cross the streams!

# Following all come from JMSProvider.properties

ms.dflt = 1000
ms.desc = Message size in bytes.
ms.type = java.lang.Integer

pp.dflt = false
pp.desc = Use persistent messages.
pp.type = java.lang.Boolean


tx.dflt = false
tx.desc = Transactionality.
tx.type = java.lang.Boolean

cc.dflt = 1
cc.desc = Commit count (transaction batching).
cc.type = java.lang.Integer
cc.xtra = The number of operations completed within a single transaction.  This only applies\n\
to test classes which only normally perform a single operation (such as Sender or Subscriber).

rf.dflt = false
rf.desc = Use RFH2 on publish
rf.type = java.lang.Boolean

mh.dflt = false
mh.desc = Use message handle on publish
mh.type = java.lang.Boolean

tp.dflt = true
tp.desc = Use one topic per publisher thread
tp.type = java.lang.Boolean
