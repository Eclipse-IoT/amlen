# IBM Cloud Bare Metal

The performance benchmarks are performed in IBM Cloud data centers on bare metal machines.

Device traffic is over the public network (bond1) and HA replication and backend application traffic is over the private network (bond0).

Unless otherwise specified LoadTest systems are colocated in the same IBM Cloud data center as the MessageSight systems.
