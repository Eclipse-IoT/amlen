<shortdesc>An overview of components and connections within an <ph
conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"></ph> solution. </shortdesc>
<conbody>
<p><xref href="#ov00002_/f1"></xref> is a deployment diagram that
is typical of <ph conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"></ph> applications.
 In the diagram, <ph
conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISMappliance"></ph> connects
many users and devices on the internet to services that are deployed
on an intranet. The users, devices, and services interact with each
other by exchanging messages through <ph
conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISMappliance"></ph>. </p>

<p><ph conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISMappliance"></ph> connects
large numbers of clients and routes large volumes of messages. <ph
conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"></ph> supports both
publish/subscribe and point-to-point messaging. Like <ph
conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/wmq"></ph>, it is a subject-based
publish subscribe broker, not a content-based broker. Unlike a content-based
broker, message-content is not queried or altered by <ph
conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"></ph>. No user-based
applications can run on <ph
conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"></ph>. <ph
conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"></ph> typically sits
alongside other edge-of-network devices with the same objectives of
forwarding large volumes of internet traffic from many different clients. </p>
<note>Subject-based publish subscribe is also known as topic-based
publish subscribe.</note>
<section><title>Connectivity</title><p>Connect clients to <ph
conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"></ph> by using MQTT,
or JMS protocols, which are natively supported. <!--You can install your own protocol by using the protocol plug-in. For
more information, see <xref format="dita" href="ov00050.dita"
