<p>There are two things that define how a message is delivered:<dl>
<dlentry>
<dt>Message persistence</dt>
<dd>The persistence of a message defines whether the message is discarded
when the server is restarted. Persistent messages are not discarded
when the server is restarted. Nonpersistent messages are discarded
when the server is restarted.</dd>
</dlentry><dlentry>
<dt>Message reliability</dt>
<dd>The reliability of a message defines how many times the message
can be received. The reliability can be at most once, at least once,
or exactly once.</dd>
</dlentry></dl>The persistence and reliability of a message is set
when the message is published. The message is delivered to <ph
conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"></ph> at that level
of persistence and reliability. However, a subscriber can request
a different level of persistence and reliability when it creates a
subscription. If the persistence and reliability levels are not the
same as the levels set by the publisher, the lower level is used to
forward the message to the subscriber.</p>
<section><title>MQTT message delivery</title><p>MQTT provides three
levels of reliability, which are known as qualities of service (QoS).
The reliability of the message determines the persistence of the message.</p><!--<p>The quality of service of a message is set when the message is published. The message is delivered to the ISM server at that QoS. However, a subscriber can request a different QoS when it creates</p><p>a topic subscription.

an acknowledgment is received. As a result, the subscriber can receive
the same message multiple times.<p>QoS 1 messages are persistent.
The message is stored on the <ph

<section><title>JMS message delivery</title><p>JMS provides two levels
of persistence for delivering messages. The reliability of the message
is determined by the persistence of the message, and by the acknowledgment
mode. An acknowledgment is the term that is used when a JMS send gets
a synchronous reply from the server.</p><p><ph
conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"></ph> supports these
standard JMS reliability modes:<dl><dlentry>
<dt>At most once, nonpersistent</dt>
<dd>A JMS message is delivered at most once if it is a nonpersistent
message (sent with JMSDeliveryMode set to NON_PERSISTENT).</dd>
<dd>This type of publication is faster but less reliable than persistent
message delivery. </dd>
<dd>The message is not stored on the <ph
conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"></ph> server. The message
might be lost if the publisher is disconnected, or if the server fails.
If a subscriber is disconnected at the time the server receives the
published message, the subscriber might not receive the message.</dd>
</dlentry><dlentry>
<dt>Exactly once, persistent</dt>
<dd>A JMS message is delivered exactly once if it is a persistent
message (sent with JMSDeliveryMode set to PERSISTENT).</dd>
<dd>This type of publication is most reliable. The message is stored
on the <ph conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"></ph> server
until it is sent to all the subscribers of the message. The message
is stored until acknowledgment is received from each subscriber.</dd>
</dlentry></dl></p><p>In addition to standard JMS reliability modes, <ph
conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"></ph> supports the
following extension:<dl><dlentry>
<dt>Fire and forget with DisableACK</dt>
<dd><ph conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"></ph> allows
for JMS message acknowledgment to be disabled with use of the <apiname>DisableACK</apiname> ConnectionFactory
property.</dd>
<dd>This type of publication is the fastest but it is also the least
reliable. Use it only when occasional message loss can be tolerated.</dd>
<dd>For fastest transmission, use <apiname>DisableACK</apiname> with
nonpersistent messages. The message is not stored on the <ph
conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"></ph> server. The message
might be lost if the publisher is disconnected, if the server fails,
or because of temporary network issues.</dd>
<dd>The <apiname>DisableACK</apiname> setting applies to messages
that are received from the server and to messages that are sent to
the server.</dd>
</dlentry></dl></p></section>
<section><title>Message delivery from JMS to MQTT</title><p>When messages
are sent from JMS applications to MQTT applications, the JMS reliability
and persistence map to MQTT quality of service (QoS) levels. For fastest
but least reliable messaging between JMS and MQTT, send nonpersistent
JMS messages with the <ph conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"></ph> DisableACK
property set to true. This configuration provides QoS 0 for MQTT subscriber
applications. For the best reliability but slowest messaging rates,
send persistent JMS messages and use per-message acknowledgment. This
configuration provides up to QoS 2 for MQTT subscribers. The following
table shows the possible combinations:</p><table frame="all"><title>Mapping
