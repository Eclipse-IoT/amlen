<title> Using F5 BIG-IP with <ph conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"/></title>
<shortdesc>You can use this documentation to create iRules to configure F5 BIG-IP to extract an MQTT client ID from an MQTT CONNECT message, perform a server map lookup, and route the connection to the appropriate <ph conref = "../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"></ph> server. </shortdesc>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>You can use this document to: <ul>
<li>Use an F5 BIG-IP iRule to extract an MQTT client ID from an MQTT CONNECT message.</li>
<li>Perform a server map lookup, and route the connection to the appropriate <ph
conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"/>.</li>
<li>Update the server map via the iFile mechanism in BigIP and learn how the configuration is
synchronized to a STANDBY BIG-IP server.</li>
<li>Terminate TLS connections on BIG-IP, and forward the device connection to one of multiple <ph
conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"/>.</li>
<li>Follow the example test of a BIG-IP VM with 8 Virtual CPUs and 64GB of memory. </li>
</ul>
</p>
</section>
<section> <title>F5 BIG-IP </title> <p>You can use F5 BIG-IP and iRules to control the route of incoming messages to servers in the
private VLAN. <image alt="F5 BIG-IP shown as a Proxy between a public and private VLAN"
href="Untitled.jpg" scalefit="yes" scale=""/></p> <p>In a high availability <ph conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"/> system, you can
configure BIG-IP using iRules, to route messages and load balance across a primary pool of servers
in the private VLAN, or failover to a standby pool pair server,  if the server in the primary pool
is not available. A ruleset can also be configured to route to messages from the standby server to
the primary server if the standby server is not available. </p> <p>The public VLAN is the network where client devices connect to BIG-IP, and the private VLAN is
the network on which BIG-IP connects to <ph conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISM"/>
servers. </p> </section>
<section>
<title>iRules</title>
<p>You can write iRules by using the F5 <i>iRule Editor</i>, an integrated code editor for network
devices, which performs basic syntax checking and provides bidirectional synchronization of iRule
updates with BIG-IP. </p> Two rules are created in BIG-IP, one dealing with the public VLAN side,
and the other dealing with the private VLAN side, for example:<ul>
<li>mqttTCP - associated with the public VLAN in BIG-IP TCP connections</li>
<li>mqttTLS - associated with the private VLAN in BIG-IP TLS connections</li>
</ul>Both rules have virtually identical code, the primary difference being the client side iRule
events which are specified, for example, CLIENTSSL_DATA as opposed to CLIENT_DATA. The sample
mqttTCP contains 215 lines of Tool Command Language (Tcl) code. The bulk of the logic is in
CLIENT_DATA where the MQTT CONNECT message is processed. Both iRules can parse the MQTT connect
message and extract the client ID and clean session flag.<ul>
<li>Minimum message length checked (or return and wait for more data on the client connection) </li>
<li>Parse MQTT fixed header and read variable length field, reject connection immediately if not
MQTT CONNECT message </li>
<li>Client ID field extracted </li>
<li>Clean Session field extracted </li>
</ul>When the MQTT client ID and clean session flag are known the sample is complete.

<title>Using a static map for client id, primary and standby server IP addresses</title>
<p>As an alternative to using the F5 BIG-IP commands you can use an iFile in RULE_INIT to create an
in-memory map of client IDs mapping to both primary and standby destination servers. You can use the
iFile across BIG-IP applications to maintain consistency, without needing to synchronize between the
BIG-IP applications. To change the client affinity you can then upload the new iFile and update the
iRule to load the updated affinity map iFile. </p>
<p>You can create an iRule to administer the table of another iRule by using a RESTful interface to
dynamically update the session tables. By using this method, persistent connection entries can be
updated dynamically by an external application. For more details see, <xref
