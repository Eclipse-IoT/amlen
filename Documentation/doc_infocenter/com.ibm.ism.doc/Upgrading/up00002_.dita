<title>Upgrading <ph conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISMappliance"

<shortdesc>System administrators can upgradeBefore you upgrade <ph
conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISMappliance"
/> to version 1.2 from version 1.1.0.1, it is good practice to create a backup of the version 1.1.0.1 configuration. You can also create a backup version of the version 1.1.0.1 store; you must apply interim fix 1.1.0.1-IBM-IMA-IFIT05459 if you need to back up the store.</shortdesc>
<conbody>
<p>A backup of the <ph
conref="../TextEntities.dita#TextEntities/ISMappliance"></ph> version
1.1.0.1 configuration is required if the upgraded appliance needs
to be rolled back to version 1.1.0.1. You might also need to back
up the version 1.1.0.1 store if you determine that the state of the
store is important before you perform the upgrade operation; the store
data can be restored as part of the rollback process.</p>
