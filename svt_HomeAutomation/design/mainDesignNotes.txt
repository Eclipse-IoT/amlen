Home Automation has four main components:
	1) A main office component that handles registration, authentication, and analytics of users and houses
	2) Sensor components that produces data about a particular measurement
	3) Control components that consume requests to perform actions
	4) Mobile devices to monitor sensor output and issue commands to controls

Each device (mobile, sensor, control) has a unique identifier.  

Each mobile device belongs to a group of mobile devices (1->many) at the main office

Each sensor is registered to the main office and to a single group of mobile devices. 

Each control is registered to the main office and to a single group of mobile devices.

mechanisms of registering a control and a sensor to the main office are left as an exercise.
