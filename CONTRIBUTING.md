# Contributing to Eclipse Amlen

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

The main webpage for Eclipse Amlen is: https://www.eclipse.org/amlen/ The main
component of Amlen is the server - a message broker that supports the latest
MQTT v5 protocol designed for IoT (as well as the older MQTTv3 and JMS 1.1). It
can be deployed in highly available, redundant configurations and has clustering
support for horizontal scalability. Aside from the server, it provides: 
1. An easy to use WebUI that makes managing and monitoring the message broker
easier
2. Bridging capabilities to other messaging systems (currently
bidirectionally to other MQTT servers and IBM MQ Queue managers) and
unidirectionally to Apache Kafka. 

The following architecture diagram shows how
the code is arranged: Key words: mqtt, Device connectivity, IoT protocols,
