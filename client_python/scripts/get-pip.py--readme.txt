PIP is the PYTHON's YUM:

Originally obtained from:  https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html

To Install, RUN:
	python get-pip.py

PIP is updated just like any other package and you may see a version update message in the future:

	[client_ship/python]# python get-pip.py
	You are using pip version 6.0.8, however version 6.1.1 is available.
	You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
	Requirement already up-to-date: pip in /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages

If you see something like that, RUN:  
	pip install --upgrade pip
	

To use the PYTHON scripts you need to PIP Install:
	pip install requests
	pip install argparse
