# Add RPM in a temporary directory inside the container
# Make sure that imawebui.rpm is available in the directory where "docker build" command
# is being executed
ADD ./imawebui.rpm /tmp/

# Update all packages
RUN yum -y upgrade 


#To run as a non-root user
# 1) Create the user and group outside the container with a selected uid/gid
#        groupadd -r -g 463 ima
#        useradd -r  -s /sbin/nologin -g ima -u 463 ima
# 2) Give that user read/write access to any volumes that will be used
# 3) Create a config file so the RPM knows the user
#        RUN echo 'user=ima' >/etc/messagesight-user.cfg
# 4) Uncomment the RUN group/useradd setup lines:
#      (Ensure the numeric uid/gid below match step 1 above)
#        RUN groupadd -r -g 463 ima
#        RUN useradd -r  -s /sbin/nologin -g ima -u 463 ima
# 5) Uncomment the USER line above the Entrypoint before the entrypoint


#Install the WebUI intself
RUN yum -y install /tmp/imawebui.rpm

# Delete imawebui.rpm from temporary directory
RUN rm -f /tmp/imawebui.rpm

#Uncomment below USER line to run as a non-root user (but do the above steps 1-4 as well!)
#USER ima:ima

# Set file permissions
RUN chmod -R +x ${IMA_WEBUI_APPSRV_INSTALL_PATH}
