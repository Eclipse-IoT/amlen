The sample_projects sub-directories contain README files and files required for 
Eclipse projects.  These files will be included in the SDK bundle with the 
appropriate source directories so that customers have the option to import 
sample source directories as Eclipse projects.

The files under jmsamples will appear in the jms sub-directory under 
ImaTools/ImaJmsClient/ in the SDK bundle. The files under 
pluginsamples/jsonmsgClient will appear in the jsonmsgClient sub-directory
under ImaTools/ImaPlugin/samples in the SDK bundle. And the files under 
pluginsamples/jsonmsgPlugin will appear in the jsonmsgPlugin sub-directory
under ImaTools/ImaPlugin/samples in the SDK bundle.
